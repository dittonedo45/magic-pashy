Magic-Pashy

You might be wondering why such a weird name. Yeah the name is *strange*, very strange because of that word Magic followed with Pashy.
Well its a name of a cartoon movie I was just watching right now. That first part "Magic ....". The last part is a nickname of my ex-girlfriend,
who told you programmers don't date, well we do. So don't try to comprehend this "nonsense" of a name.
Therefore I made it into a Github repo to make sense out of it. Now its a repository, where I post all of my codes tests on web development.
Front-end related. There will be many branches some for CSS, tailwind, javascript, React.js and so on.

If you want to flex on me. Flex!!, Show me what you can do better, I will definitely merge your pull request. Am a sticker giver, especially on web development.
